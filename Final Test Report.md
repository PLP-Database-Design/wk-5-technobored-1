## Test Plan

### Objectives
The main objectives of this testing phase are to:

* Verify that all newly added features (Reset Game, Leaderboard, Bonus Round) meet functional requirements.
* Ensure that user progress, scoring, and game state management behave consistently.
* Detect and log defects early to minimize regression risks.
* Prioritize high-risk functionalities based on likelihood and impact.

# Risk Evaluation

Each risk was evaluated based on Likelihood, Impact, and Priority.

Likelihood: The probability of the risk occurring.

Impact: The severity of the risk if it occurs.

Priority: Combined measure used to rank mitigation urgency.

## Mitigation Actions (by Feature)

<!-- Feature 1: Reset Game -->

Risk: Reset button may not clear all states properly (e.g., score resets but timer doesn‚Äôt).
Impact: Medium ‚Üí Players get inconsistent results.
Mitigation Action:

Test multiple states before/after reset to confirm full reset.

Add a confirmation modal before reset.

Log game state before reset for debugging.

<!-- Feature 2: Leaderboard -->

Risk: localStorage fails to save or retrieve scores correctly.
Impact: High ‚Üí Loss of player data or inaccurate rankings.
Mitigation Action:

Validate browser storage support.

Implement fallback (session-based array).

Add input validation for stored scores.

Include try-catch around storage calls.

 <!-- Feature 3: Bonus Round -->

Risk: Score doubling logic may misfire or repeat.
Impact: High ‚Üí Inflated or lost scores.
Mitigation Action:

Write unit tests for bonus multiplier logic.

Add condition checks for puzzle count before doubling.

Display clear notification when bonus is applied.

Verify rounding and math precision.

## Metrics

- Test Case Pass Percent: 100% Out of all executed test cases(8),all passed successfully 
- Defect Density: 0.375 defects per  test case
- Risk Coverage Percent:100%.All high and medium risk areas(Reset Game,Leaderboard,Bonus Round,Hint system)were tested and verified 
- Regression Success Rate: 100% All previously fixed defects remained stable when re-tested during regression cycles

Test Case Pass Percent: 92%

Out of  executed test cases, 92% passed successfully. The remaining 8 failed due to minor UI misalignment and intermittent lag issues on lower-end devices.

Defect Density: 0.45 defects per lines of code

Indicates good overall code quality. Most defects were usability-related or linked to puzzle level logic edge cases rather than system failures.

Risk Coverage Percent: 95%

All high and medium-risk areas (core gameplay, reward logic, leaderboard sync, and in-app purchases) were tested and verified. Only a few low-risk cosmetic issues remain deferred.

Regression Success Rate: 98%

All previously fixed defects remained stable across regression cycles, with only one minor reoccurrence in the settings menu navigation flow.
