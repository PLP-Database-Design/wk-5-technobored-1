| **R1** | **Leaderboard**           | LocalStorage may fail or be unavailable, causing loss of saved scores               | Medium     | High   | **High**   | Implement fallback to in-memory storage and error handling for failed writes |
| **R2** | **Reset Game**            | Reset may not properly clear score or progress, leading to inconsistent state       | Medium     | Medium | **Medium** | Add test cases verifying all variables (score, solved, hint) reset correctly |
| **R3** | **Bonus Round**           | Bonus logic may trigger incorrectly (e.g., after wrong count) or not apply score √ó2 | Medium     | High   | **High**   | Validate logic with unit and functional testing across multiple rounds       |
| **R4** | **Hint System**           | Multiple hints could be triggered, reducing score repeatedly or breaking balance    | Low        | Medium | **Medium** | Lock hint button after one use until next puzzle loads                       |

# Risk Evaluation

Each risk was evaluated based on Likelihood, Impact, and Priority.

Likelihood: The probability of the risk occurring.

Impact: The severity of the risk if it occurs.

Priority: Combined measure used to rank mitigation urgency.

## Mitigation Actions (by Feature)

<!-- Feature 1: Reset Game -->

Risk: Reset button may not clear all states properly (e.g., score resets but timer doesn‚Äôt).
Impact: Medium ‚Üí Players get inconsistent results.
Mitigation Action:

Test multiple states before/after reset to confirm full reset.

Add a confirmation modal before reset.

Log game state before reset for debugging.

<!-- Feature 2: Leaderboard -->

Risk: localStorage fails to save or retrieve scores correctly.
Impact: High ‚Üí Loss of player data or inaccurate rankings.
Mitigation Action:

Validate browser storage support.

Implement fallback (session-based array).

Add input validation for stored scores.

Include try-catch around storage calls.

 <!-- Feature 3: Bonus Round -->

Risk: Score doubling logic may misfire or repeat.
Impact: High ‚Üí Inflated or lost scores.
Mitigation Action:

Write unit tests for bonus multiplier logic.

Add condition checks for puzzle count before doubling.

Display clear notification when bonus is applied.

Verify rounding and math precision.
